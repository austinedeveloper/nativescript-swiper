/*
In NativeScript, the app.css file is where you place CSS rules that
you would like to apply to your entire application. Check out
http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling for a full list of the CSS
selectors and properties you can use to style UI components.

/*
For example, the following CSS rule changes the font size of all UI
components that have the btn class name.
*/
.bg-white{
	background-color: #ffffff;
}
.bg-blue{
	background-color: #2196f3;
}
.bg-green{
	background-color: #2baf2b;
}
.bg-red{
	background-color: #e84e40;
}
.bg-blue-light{
	background-color: #5bc0de;
}
.bg-yellow{
	background-color: #f0ad4e;
}
.bg-silver{
    background-color: silver;
}

/*
In many cases you may want to use the NativeScript core theme instead
of writing your own CSS rules. For a full list of class names in the theme
refer to http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme.
